WP-Post-Banners is wordpress plugin that can mine your Wordpress and generate 'featured' section for your site using the
found items.

== Description ==

WP-Post-Banners is a standalone script / wordpress plugin that can mine your Wordpress posts or any other
data and look for images suiting a given dimension and generates 'featured' section for your site using the
found items.

The featured section, includes a resized image (banner) with the label, description and link of the related
post or data.

Currently it supports a Wordpress plugin mode (with widget support) and a standalone mode. It's very easy
to integrate it to your Wordpress installation or any other blog / cms / forum software even in your
static data site.

Right now it supports two output styles; simple banners and slideshow mode.

= Simple Banners Mode =

In this mode, all suitable items are vertically positioned. Check [here](http://postbanners.huseyinuslu.net/index.php?wptheme=get_post_banners) to see a simple banners demo.

To use this mode, just call the function get_post_banners()

      <?php if (function_exists('get_post_banners')): ?>
      <?php get_post_banners(300,150); ?>
      <?php endif; ?>

get_post_banners() accepts 4 arguments;

* Banner image width
* Maximum banner image height (means actual rendered banners may be lesser than this value)
* (Optional) Maximum number of banners to be rendered
* (Optional) Filter - valid under wordpress and filters the posts returned by wordpress. For more information about avaible filtering options check [here](http://www.huseyinuslu.net/wp-post-banners-wordpress-filters).

So let's examine this call;

      <?php if (function_exists('get_post_banners')): ?>
      <?php get_post_banners(300,100,10,'numberposts=10&orderby=rand'); ?>
      <?php endif; ?>

This code will at maximum render 10 banners and wordpress returns us 10 posts to examine. And orderby=rand makes wordpress to select random posts and return us.

= Slideshow Mode =
In slideshow mode, all suitable items are shown as slideshow.  Check [here](http://postbanners.huseyinuslu.net/index.php?wptheme=Slideshow) to see a slideshow demo.

To use this mode just call the function get_slideshow()

      <?php if (function_exists('get_slideshow')): ?>
      <?php get_slideshow(300,150); ?>
      <?php endif; ?>

get_slideshow() accepts 4 arguments which are exactly the same with get_post_banners arguments.

* Ýmage width
* Maximum image height (means actual rendered images may be lesser than this value)
* (Optional) Maximum number of banners to be rendered
* (Optional) Filter - valid under wordpress and filters the posts returned by wordpress. For more information about avaible filtering options check [here](http://www.huseyinuslu.net/wp-post-banners-wordpress-filters).

= Widget Mode =

The plugin supports running as Widget for Wordpress. Todo so just browse to your Wordpress installations administator section and then
Design - Widgets section. There you can add Post Banners (Simple Banners) or Post Banners Slideshow widgets to your theme.

Check [here](http://postbanners.huseyinuslu.net/index.php?wptheme=Widget) to see a widget demo.

You can set these options for widgets:

* Widget title: Give it a title
* Image Width: Set the banner width
* Image Height: Set the maximum banner height
* Max Items: (Optional) Set maximum amount of items
* Post Filter:  (Optional) Set post filter. 

= Stand Alone Mode =

With the release of 0.5 version you can just run the WP-Post-Banners as a standalone script. You can use it your own static site
by supplying data manually or even use it in any other blog / CMS / forum software by just writing the data pump function.

Check [here](http://postbanners.huseyinuslu.net/wp-content/plugins/wp-post-banners/standalone.php) to see a stand-alone demo.

First lets see manuall data pumping; 

1) Include engine.php in your site
	
      include 'engine.php'; 


2) Initiate the engine class

      $e=new engine(); 
      $e->layer("STAND_ALONE");


3) Set configuration; width, height and maximum items

      $e->width="300"; 	
      $e->height="220"; 	
      $e->max_items=2;


4) Start pumping the content

      $p=new post_item(); // new content item
      $p->img="<img src='http://www.huseyinuslu.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/iloled-300x200.png'>"; // image
      $p->label="Sample Post I"; // label
      $p->content="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."; // description
      $p->link="http://www.huseyinuslu.net/wp-post-banners"; // related url
      $e->add_item($p); // add the item


5) Let the wp-post-banners do the magic and render.

* To render in Simple Banners mode use render()

      echo $e->render();


* To render slideshow use render_slideshow()

      echo $e->render_slideshow();


6) Free the resources used

      $e=null; // release resources


Within the distributed files, there's an example script 'standalone.php'.


= Porting plugin to other Blog / CMS / Forum Software =

By reading the standalone instructions and following sample data pumper for Wordpress you can just port the plugin to any other blog / cms / forum software
with coding a few lines.

To do so, take this Wordpress pumper code as a basis for your work and don't forget to contact plugin author about your work so that he can include it with main distribution.

      function get_slideshow($width,$height,$max=999,$filter='')
      {
            $e=new engine(); 
            $e->layer("WORDPRESS"); // when porting you'd like to use STAND_ALONE mode or code your own layer
            $e->width=$width; 	
            $e->height=$height; 	
            $e->max_items=$max;
            $posts=get_posts($filter); 
	
            foreach($posts as $post) 	
            { 		
                  setup_postdata($post); 		
                  $p=new post_item(); 		
                  $p->img=$post->post_content; 		
                  $p->content=$post->post_content; 		
                  $p->link=get_permalink($post->ID); 		
                  $p->label=$post->post_title; 		
                  $e->add_item($p); 	
            } 	 		
	
            echo $e->render_slideshow($width,$height); 
	
            $e=null; // release resources
}

WP-Post-Banners version 0.50 and below was coded for php5 and when you try to run it under php4 you'll get this error. With version 0.51, php4 is supported. So either use plugin version 0.51 or upgrade to php5.
